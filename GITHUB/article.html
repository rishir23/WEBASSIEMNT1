  <h1>New Community Garden Brings Neighbors Together</h1>
  
  <h2>Grand Opening Celebration</h2>
  <p>The city’s newest community garden officially opened last Saturday with a ribbon-cutting ceremony and free workshops for local families. Dozens of volunteers worked for months to transform an empty lot into a green space full of vegetables, flowers, and native plants.</p>

  <p>According to the organizers, the garden will provide fresh produce for families and teach kids about healthy eating. <q>“This project shows what we can do when we work together,”</q> said volunteer coordinator Jamie Lee.</p>

  <p><strong>Next month</strong>, the garden team will host planting classes and garden tours for students. Anyone interested in volunteering can sign up at the community center.</p>
