                The city's newest community garden officially opened last Saturday with a ribbon-cutting ceremony and free workshops for local families. Dozens of volunteers worked for months to transform an empty lot into a green space full of vegetables, flowers, and native plants.

                According to the organizers, the garden will provide fresh produce for families and teach kids about healthy eating. "This project shows what we can do when we work together," said volunteer coordinator Jamie Lee.

                Next month, the garden team will host planting classes and garden tours for students. Anyone interested in volunteering can sign up at the community center.
